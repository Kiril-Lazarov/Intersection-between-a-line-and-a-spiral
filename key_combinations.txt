Coordinate system:

The visualization of all objects uses a standard Cartesian coordinate system. It is controlled using the following combinations:

c - toggle the coordinate system on/off 
z + up/down arrow - zoom in/zoom out 
h + up/down/left/right arrow - move the coordinate system in the respective direction.



Spiral:

s - toggle the spiral on/off

t + up/down arrow - incr/decr the time `t`; non-negative values 
v + up/down arrow - incr/decr the radial speed `v`; non-negative values 
w + up/down arrow - incr/decr the angular speed `w`; real values 
Shift + w - change the spiral direction
k + up/down arrow - incr/decr the coefficient of the initial angle of expansion of the spiral `k`; values from 0 to 4 

Shift + e + right/left arrow - increase/decrease the degree of the x-component of the parametric spiral; integer values 
Shift + e + up/down arrow - increase/decrease the degree of the y-component of the parametric spiral; integer values



Line:

Two modes - vertical line and inclined line

g - toggle the mode from vertical to inclined line and vice versa

l - toggle the line on/off

When g = off - vertical line:

x + right/left arrow - move the vertical line to the right/left; real values

When g = on - inclined line:

a + up/down arrow - incr/decr the slope; real values 
b + up/down arrow - incr/decr the height of the inclined line; real values



Intersection points:

n - toggle the initial values of the algorithm (black points) 
m - toggle the intersection points (purple points)



Fine-Tuning of Parameters:

All parameters of the line and the spiral (except for the exponent) are continuous real values. Control over them is applied in discrete steps. Each parameter has default values (for example, the _ parameter has a default step of 0.01), which can be adjusted for finer or coarser control.

Ctrl + f - toggle step adjustment settings.

When steps controls = on:

t + up/down arrow - incr/decr the `t` step by a factor of 10.
v + up/down arrow  - incr/decr the `v` step by a factor of 10.
w + up/down arrow  - incr/decr the `w` step by a factor of 10.
k + up/down arrow  - incr/decr the `k` step by a factor of 10.
x + up/down arrow  - incr/decr the `x` step by a factor of 10.
a + up/down arrow  - incr/decr the `a` step by a factor of 10.
b + up/down arrow  - incr/decr the `b` step by a factor of 10.



Algorithm Mode:

Displays the step-by-step approximation of the spiralâ€™s radius vector toward its intersection point with the line. Available for both vertical and inclined lines.

Ctrl + a - toggle the algorithm mode

If algorithm mode = on:

n + up/down arrow - move forward/backward through the initial radius vectors;  non-negative integers

m + up/down - move forward/backward through the successive approximations to the intersection point;  non-negative integers



t-Diagram Mode:

Represents the spiral as waves with variable amplitude. The horizontal axis corresponds to time `t` , while the vertical axis simultaneously represents the `x` and `y` coordinates of the corresponding point on the spiral curve as a function of `t`. Available when the algorithm mode is off.
The spiral, line, and intersection points are drawn using the previously described key combinations.

Ctrl + t - toggle t-diagram mode.



Derivatives Mode:

Displays the three derivatives of the parameterized Archimedean spiral at any given point as slanted straight lines. Not available when algotithm mode = on. Available in the Cartesian coordinate system and in t-diagram mode.

d - toggle derivatives mode.
