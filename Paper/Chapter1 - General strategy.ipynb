    "    \n",
    "The project sets two main objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To develop an analytical method for calculating the intersection points between two mathematical objects – a straight line and an Archimedean spiral.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To express this method in mathematical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first objective, it will be necessary to parameterize the Archimedean spiral.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second objective involves defining a special type of functions, which, for convenience, will be referred to as binary functions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <center> 1.1 Parameterization of an Archimedean spiral\n",
    "    \n",
    "The formula for the Archimedean spiral is:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$r = a + b\\theta, \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.1)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where\n",
    "    \n",
    "+ $r$ is the radius of the spiral (the distance from the center of the spiral to the point).\n",
    "+ $\\theta$ is the angle in polar coordinates (measured in radians).\n",
    "+ $a$ is the initial radius (the distance from the center when $\\theta$ = 0).\n",
    "+ $b$ determines the distance between the turns of the spiral (the rate of expansion). \n",
    "    \n",
    "If we want to express the Archimedean spiral component-wise in the Cartesian coordinate system, we will have the following two equations:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$x_s = rcos\\theta, \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.2)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$y_s = rsin\\theta. \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations for \n",
    "$x_s$ and $y_s$ of an Archimedean spiral in the Cartesian coordinate system are not functions because, due to the periodicity of the sine and cosine functions, there are multiple values for $x_s$ and $y_s$ for each value of the angle of rotation $\\theta$. To solve this problem, we will use standard parameterization for the two equations by introducing the parameter $t$. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Movements in nature can generally be classified into two categories: rotational and translational. In rotational motion, the points of an object move around a fixed axis (real or imaginary), describing circular trajectories. In translational motion, all points of an object move in the same direction and at the same speed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Archimedean spiral can be thought of as the trajectory of one point rotating around another point - the center. It represents the simplest case of a combination of the two types of motion: the rotation of a point around another point at a constant angular velocity, combined with a change in distance (radius) at a constant linear velocity. Therefore, it makes sense for the Archimedean spiral to be represented as a process over time, i.e., as a function of $t$. If we place the point around which the other point rotates at the center of the Cartesian coordinate system, then the distance between the two can be represented as a radius vector.\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$|\\vec {R}(t)| = vt, \\quad v \\ge 0, \\quad t \\ge 0. \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.4)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "This formula gives the increase in the length of the radius vector as a function of time $t$. In this project, we will consider only non-negative values for time. The velocity $v$ will also be taken as non-negative since the spiral is expanding from the center of the coordinate system. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Similarly to the increase of the radius vector, we will represent the angle of rotation as increasing linearly as a function of time.\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$\\theta = wt, \\quad w \\ne 0, \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.5)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $w$ is the angular velocity, which can take positive and negative values corresponding to the direction of rotation, counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively. \n",
    "When $w=0$, there is no rotation, and therefore, there is no spiral.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Substituting the last two equations into (1.1.2) and (1.1.3) for $x_s$ and $y_s$, we get:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$x_s(t) = vtcos(wt), \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.6)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$y_s(t) = vtsin(wt). \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.7)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "These equations cannot be solved analytically because $t$ is a multiplier both outside and inside the trigonometric functions, and it cannot be removed from the trigonometric functions. Therefore, it is not possible to isolate the parameter $t$ on one side of the equation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In other words, we cannot analytically determine the value of $t$ for given values of $x_s$, $y_s$, $v$ and $w$. In situations like this, numerical methods with approximations are usually employed. Here, we will also do this, with the difference that the first value of the algorithm is not arbitrary, but derived analytically.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The last two formulas, in this form, have the limitation of defining only an Archimedean spiral with an initial angle equal to zero. In fact, a spiral can start unfolding from another initial angle. For example, 45 degrees. To correct this, we will introduce the initial angle $\\theta_0$ into the trigonometric functions. Thus, the equations take the form:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$x_s(t) = vtcos(\\theta_0 + wt), \\quad 0 \\le \\theta_0  < 2\\pi, \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.8)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$y_s(t) = vtsin(\\theta_0 + wt),  \\quad 0 \\le \\theta_0  < 2\\pi.\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.9)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "We introduce this restriction in the domain of $\\theta_0$ for simplicity and easier work with this parameter. We will also add another representation of it as a multiple of $\\pi/2$ . For this purpose, we introduce the parameter $k$, which, due to the restriction of $\\theta_0$, will have values between 0 and 4. Then\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$x_s(t) = vtcos(k\\frac{\\pi}{2} + wt), \\quad 0 \\le k < 4, \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.10)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$y_s(t) = vtsin(k\\frac{\\pi}{2} + wt),  \\quad 0 \\le k < 4. \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.1.11)$$  \n",
    "    \n",
    "Expressing the initial angle as a multiple of $\\pi/2$ has some significant advantages for reasons that will be clarified later in the exposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulas 1.1.10 and 1.1.11 provide a complete mathematical description of possible Archimedean spirals. If we look at them from a slightly more general perspective, we can say that they represent a transformation of time into space. The algorithm that will be presented here is based on the inverse transformation - space to time. In this sense, it can be thought of as the inverse function of these formulas, although it is incomparably more complex.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <center> 1.2 Binary functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "The second main task of this project – expressing the method for finding the intersection points between a straight line and an Archimedean spiral purely mathematically – requires the definition of functions that reduce a real number, the input parameter of the function, to one of two possible values, most commonly 0 or 1, with respect to some characteristic of the number. These functions serve the same role as if-else checks in programming languages. In practice, they are their mathematical equivalent. The problem of finding intersection points is deeply connected with making numerous checks of given conditions and deciding how to calculate these points based on the configuration of the spiral's and the straight line's parameters. For example, whether the spiral rotates clockwise or counterclockwise – i.e., the sign of the angular velocity $w$; in which quadrant the initial angle $\\theta_0$ is, i.e., the parameter $k$; where the line is positioned relative to the coordinate axes, and so on. These checks are easily made in a programming language, but the goal here is to derive a mathematical equation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In mathematics, binary functions are already defined. One example of such a function is the indicator function\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$f(x) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "1, & \\text{if } x \\in A, \\\\\n",
    "0, & \\text{if } x \\notin A,\n",
    "\\end{cases} \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.2.1)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "where $A$ is some set, but it is essentially the same as if-else statements and cannot be directly included in a mathematical expression.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Another binary function that can be directly applied in a mathematical expression is the $sigmoid function$\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$f(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-kx}}\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.2.2)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "but it has the following two disadvantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. It does not provide an exact value, and\n",
    "2. It requires intensive computations for large values of $x$ and/or $k$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For the purposes of this project, such computations are not necessary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### <center> 1.2.1 Basic binary functions\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will define two basic binary functions, which will serve as the foundation for more complex binary functions. They consist of operations with standard mathematical operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, etc. - on real variables. We will also define a special notation for them. This is necessary for better readability and to avoid overloading the mathematical expression of the final equation for the intersection points, which is very long and practically unreadable. The notation is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "$$Name_{(inputs)}^{[outputs]} = expression.\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad (1.2.1.1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left-hand side of the equation, we place the name of the function. It can be a single letter, an abbreviation, a word, or an expression. If it is a single letter, it should be uppercase. If it is an abbreviation, the letters should also be uppercase. If it is a word, the first letter should be uppercase and the rest lowercase. If it is an expression, the words are written together, with each word starting with an uppercase letter. The reasons for adopting this notation are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uppercase letters:  -  if the function is named with a single letter, we use an uppercase letter to avoid confusion with a regular variable, constant, or parameter. We will use single letters for the basic binary functions, as they will be used most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the name is a full word or an expression, we use uppercase initial letters for better readability. When the binary function is very specific, we follow the programming practice of giving it a short, descriptive name.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the function's name, we place the arguments in the lower-right index in round brackets, separated by commas. The reason we do not put the arguments in parentheses immediately after the function's name is to avoid confusion with a standard function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upper-right index, we use square brackets to record the outputs of the function - usually 0 or 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first basic function we will define is a function that checks whether its argument is a non-integer or not. We will call it $B$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "$$B^{[0,1]}_{(x)} = \\lceil x \\rceil - \\lfloor x \\rfloor,\\quad x \\in \\mathbb{R},\\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad(1.2.1.2)$$\n",
