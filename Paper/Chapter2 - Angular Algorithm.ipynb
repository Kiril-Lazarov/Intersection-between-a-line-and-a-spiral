    "As already demonstrated, this problem has no analytical solution. More precisely, there is no analytical solution when $x_l \\ne 0$. However, an analytical solution exists when $x_l = 0$, i.e., when the line coincides with the $y$-axis. The $y$-axis, after all, is also a straight line; it is simply positioned at the center of the coordinate system along the $x$-axis. An analytical solution for $x_l = 0$ exists because the exact moments $t_n$, when the spiral curve intersects the $y$-axis, can be calculated through angle transformation. Since the spiral starts to unfold from the center of the coordinate system, the rotation of its radius vector describes a central angle. Therefore, the angle at which the radius vector must rotate to intersect the $y$-axis can be computed analytically.\n",

On the left side of the image, these correspond to $w$ (in the images, we will use $w$ instead of $\\omega$ due to technical reasons), $k$ and **start_angle**. The radius vector, therefore, must be rotated by 90 degrees to intersect the $y$-axis. Given this angle, its transformation over time is governed by the angular velocity $\\omega$ from the formula 1.1.5. Expressing $t$ we have:\n",
