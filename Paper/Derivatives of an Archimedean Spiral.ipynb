    "In the image above, all three derivatives are shown at a point on the spiral corresponding to the moment $t = 9.44$ and coordinates $x_s = -1.73968$ and $y_s = -4.3877$. As can be seen, the green line $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is tangent to the spiral curve at this point with a slope of $-27.674758$ degrees, while the other two $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ are secants to it. To verify that $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ are indeed the derivatives of their respective components, we will present the same situation in a different coordinate system. We will refer to this coordinate system as the $txy$-diagram or, for brevity, simply $t$-diagram."

    "On the abscissa, we have the values of $t$ ($t \\ge 0$), while on the ordinate, we have the values of $x_s$ and $y_s$. The black radius vector represents the radius vector of the spiral at the corresponding moment $t$. The green line, connecting the tip of the radius vector to the center of the coordinate axis, represents the growth of the radius vector as a function of time. The red sinusoid represents the values of the $x$-coordinate of the radius vector from the initial moment $t=0$ to the current one. Similarly, the blue sinusoid represents the values of the $y$-coordinate. The derivatives $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, $\\frac{dy}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ are the straight lines in the respective component colors, and the points indicate the exact positions of the tangents.\n",

    "In the $t$-diagram, the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is not visualized as a tangent to the spiral curve because the spiral curve is decomposed into its components. In the normal coordinate system, only this derivative appears as a tangent, while the other two do not.\n",

    "The graphs of the components of the parameterized Archimedean spiral represent sinusoids with increasing amplitude, as it is a combination of rotational motion with constant angular velocity and a linear increase of the radius vector."
